package Libraries.Language.Errors

use Libraries.Language.Errors.Error

/*
The InvalidPathError class is an error or exception that is thrown when
a path specified for a required operation is not valid. There may be many
reasons for this, including referencing a path using illegal characters
(such as including a "<" in a file name on Windows), or if a specific type
of path is required and is not given (e.g. an absoltue path vs. a relative
path). 

Attribute: Example

use Libraries.Language.Errors.EndOfFileError
use Libraries.Containers.File

class Main
   action Main
      File file
      check
        file:SetRelativePath("C:\hello.txt") // see "Path" documentation for more information on absolute vs. relative paths.
      detect e is InvalidPathError
        // We will detect an error here, as "C:\hello.txt" is not a relative path!
        output "Bad path: " + e:GetErrorMessage()
      end
   end
end
*/


class InvalidPathError is Error
    on create
        SetErrorMessage("InvalidPathError: The specified path is not valid for this operation.")
    end
