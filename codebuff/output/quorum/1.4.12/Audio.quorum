/*
The Audio class can be used to play sound files and change how they are played.
Before playing audio, a file must be loaded first. For most audio, this is done
with a normal Load action. If you want to load a long audio file, like a song or
music, you can use the advanced LoadToStream action instead. The Audio class
will support audio files with the .wav or .ogg extensions. If you try to load a
different file type, or try to play audio before you've loaded a file, a generic
runtime Error will be thrown. After you're done with the Audio, you should call
Dispose() to let the system know you're done with the file.


Attribute: Example

use Libraries.Sound.Audio
use Libraries.System.File

// We need to first create Audio and File objects to use.
Audio audio
File file

// We have to set our file so its path is the file we want to use for Audio.
// When writing your own code, test.wav should be replaced with your file.
file:SetPath("test.wav")

// Now that our file is set up, we can load that file as audio.
audio:Load(file)

// After we load the file, we can play it with a call to PlayUntilDone().
audio:PlayUntilDone()

    The LoadToStream action will prepare an audio file to be streamed. While a

        EnableListenerDoppler will make the audio engine consider the velocity
        of the listener when calculating doppler effects. The listener is
        universal to all audio objects, which means that if you enable doppler
        calculations for the listener, it will enable it when calculating
        doppler for ALL audio objects. By default, the listener already has
        doppler enabled, but this will have no effect until the listener is
        given a velocity.

        Attribute: Example

        use Libraries.Sound.Audio

        Audio audio
        audio:Load("Whale.wav")

        // In order to hear the doppler effect in action, the listener needs
        // to have velocity.
        audio:SetListenerVelocity(5, 0, 4)

        // is already on, so this is only needed if we'd previously disabled it.

        have doppler enabled when calculating the doppler shift. The listener
        is universal to all audio objects, so disabling doppler effect on the
