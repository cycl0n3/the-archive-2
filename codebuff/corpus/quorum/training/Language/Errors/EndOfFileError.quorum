an attempt is made to read from a file when the end of the file has been reached.
For example, reading an empty file will quickly result in an EndOfFileError.

use Libraries.Language.Errors.EndOfFileError
use Libraries.Containers.File

class Main
   action Main
      File file
      check
        file:OpenForRead("empty.txt")
        text line1 = file:ReadLine()
        text line2 = file:ReadLine() // will raise EndOfFileError
      detect e is EndOfFileError
        output "Reached end of file: " + e:GetErrorMessage()
