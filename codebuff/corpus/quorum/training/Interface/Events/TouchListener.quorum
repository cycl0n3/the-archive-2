The TouchListener class is used to listen for and react to TouchEvents where
the user has begun touching or stopped touching the screen, or is moving a
finger across the screen. To use a TouchListener in a program, users should make
a new class that inherits from it and overrides TouchBegan, TouchFinished, or
TouchContinued.
