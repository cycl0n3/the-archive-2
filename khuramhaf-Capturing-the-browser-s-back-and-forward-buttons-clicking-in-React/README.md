In this project I am capturing the browser's back and forward button click in React.js. I am running different animation when the user click on Back button and a different animation when the user click on browser's forward button. This is although a not perfect solution and having few problems but it is a good way to start. Please post me any problem that you find in the website or feel free to contact me @ khuramhaf@gmail.com if you need any support
