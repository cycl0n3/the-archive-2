## Who is the book for?
This book assumes basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, React, and JavaScript. However, we've aimed to explain every line of code in our book. In cases where we do not describe a feature of JavaScript, React, or frameworks and packages that we use, we provide links for you to learn about them.
