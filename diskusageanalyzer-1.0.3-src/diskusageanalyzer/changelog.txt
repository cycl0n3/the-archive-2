DiskUsageAnalyzer changelog
---------------------------

1.0.3
-----
- Fixed incorrect usage of java.awt.Desktop class before determining if the
  Desktop API is supported on the current platform.

1.0.2
-----
- When running on Mac OS X, the program now uses the native Mac OS X file dialog
  when selecting the directory to analyze.

1.0.1
-----
- Added the ability to simulate a right click by Ctrl-clicking to bring up a
  context menu (useful for Macs with only one mouse button).
- Added a 'New window' menu option, available when running on Mac OS X. This was
  added since it is inconvenient and non-trivial to start multiple instances of
  an application in Mac OS X.

1.00
----
- Added "." to the listings of a directory, meaning only the files in that
  directory excluding subdirectories. Makes it easier to spot where the heavy
  data is.
- "Refresh subtree" functionality added, making it easier to incrementally clean
  up unused data from the disk. You can now delete some files in your Download
  directory and immediately refresh that directory to update that part of the
  disk usage tree.
  This function is accessed through right-clicking on a folder in the disk usage
  tree.
- "Open" functionality added, also in the right-click menu of a folder. This
  invokes environment-specific routines for opening a window displaying a
  folder's contents.
- Status field added at the bottom of the application, displaying which
  directory is currently being analyzed.
- Abort functionality added, displaying the (incomplete) tree that has been
  built so far.
- Made the application remember the last directory that was browsed, instead of
  always reverting to OS default.
- Added drag and drop for directories onto the application window, as method of
  specifying the directory to analyze.

0.80

- First release
