# Chapter 18 - jOOQ SPI (providers and listeners)

jOOQ provides a lot of hooks that allow us to alter its default behavior at different levels. Among these hooks, we have the lightweight settings and configurations, and the heavy-duty extremely stable Service Provider Interface (SPI) made of generators, providers, listeners, parsers, and so on. So, like any robust and mature technology, jOOQ comes with an impressive SPI dedicated to those corner cases where the core technology cannot help.
